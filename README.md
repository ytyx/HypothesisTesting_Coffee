# Hypothesis Testing 
## Overview
This project provides a case study involving basic concepts of hypothesis testing. Hypothesis testing is a powerful statistical technique used to make data-driven decisions and draw meaningful conclusions. In this case study, we will explore a real-life scenario where hypothesis testing is applied to answer a specific question or problem.

### Basic Understandings
Hypothesis tests are not the most glamorous statistical tool, but they do provide the foundation for the more interesting ones like linear regression, ANOVA, etc. Hypothesis tests are so fundamental the term "significant" has been adopted as the shorthand for "having the p-value of our hypothesis test be less than our alpha". So they are often the silent force in the background which are taken for granted but essential for the rest of our statistical analyses.
​
### Uses
Hypothesis tests are also used by themselves in a lot of research in the social and hard sciences, as the primary tool. In a more technical sense, aside from being the base test for many statistical tools, a number of model assumptions such as heteroskedasticity can be tested with hypothesis tests to unsure a model is valid.

### In-class Case Study
We implemented a one-sample z test to determine the proportion of the people in the nation who drink coffee every day.

#### Steps
- Data collection
- Setting up hypothesis
- Calculating test statistics
- Interpreting test results
- Conclusion

### Risks
One of the biggest issues with hypothesis testing is considering alpha. While convention sets it to .05, alpha is not set in stone; .05 is just the standard to balance false positives vs. flase negatives. When running many hypothesis tests and to avoid p-hacking it can be beneficial to make an adjustment to alpha.
